# Minimal PWA Boilerplate

This is a super minimal Progressive Web App (PWA) boilerplate, built with **zero frameworks**, **no Node.js**, and **no NPM**. It's designed for developers who want a pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript foundation to build fast, reliable, and engaging web applications without any external dependencies or complex build tooling.

/your-app

├── manifest.json             # PWA manifest

## Why this boilerplate?

In a world of ever-growing frameworks and build processes, this boilerplate offers a refreshing return to basics. It's perfect for:

* **Learning PWA fundamentals:** Understand how service workers, web app manifests, and client-side JavaScript interact without abstraction.
* **Ultra-lightweight projects:** When every kilobyte matters, this boilerplate keeps your app tiny and performant.
* **Quick prototypes:** Spin up a PWA proof-of-concept in minutes.
* **Vanilla JS enthusiasts:** Embrace the power of the browser with direct control over your codebase.

---

## Features

* **PWA Ready:** Includes a basic `service-worker.js` for offline caching and a `manifest.json` for home screen installation.
* **Pure HTML, CSS, JS:** No frameworks, just the core web technologies.
* **TypeScript Support:** Write maintainable, type-safe JavaScript using TypeScript.
* **No Build Tools:** No Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, or any other bundler. Just open `index.html` in your browser.
* **Minimal Footprint:** Focuses on essential PWA features without any unnecessary overhead.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd minimal-pwa-boilerplate
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html`:**

    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. That's it!

3.  **Explore the files:**

    * `index.html`: Your main application entry point.
    * `css/style.css`: For your application's styling.
    * `js/main.ts`: Where your main application logic, written in TypeScript, resides. This file is referenced in `index.html` and should be transpiled to `js/main.js`.
    * `js/service-worker.ts`: Your service worker script, responsible for caching and offline capabilities. This also needs to be transpiled to `js/service-worker.js`.
    * `manifest.json`: Defines your PWA's metadata (name, icons, start URL, display mode).
    * `assets/`: A place for your app icons and other static assets.

## TypeScript Workflow

Since there are no build tools included in the boilerplate, you have a couple of options for using TypeScript:

### Option 1: Browser-based Transpilation (for development/simple cases)

This boilerplate is set up to transpile TypeScript directly in the browser using a `<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/typescript@latest/lib/typescript.min.js"></script>` reference. This is great for quick testing and small experiments, but **not recommended for production** due to potential performance overhead.

### Option 2: Local `tsc` Compilation (Recommended)

For a more robust development workflow and production builds, you'll want to compile your TypeScript files (`.ts`) into JavaScript (`.js`) locally.

1.  **Install TypeScript globally (if you haven't already):**

    ```bash
    npm install -g typescript
    ```

    *(Yes, this uses `npm`, but it's only for the TypeScript compiler itself, not for your app's runtime dependencies.)*

2.  **Compile your TypeScript:**

    Navigate to the root of your project in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    tsc --init # Only run this once to create tsconfig.json
    tsc         # Compile all .ts files based on tsconfig.json
    ```

    Make sure your `tsconfig.json` is configured to output `.js` files to the correct locations (e.g., `outDir: "./js"`).

## PWA Features in Action

* **Offline Support:** Once the service worker is registered (you can check your browser's DevTools -> Application -> Service Workers), your app will be cached and available even without a network connection.
* **Add to Home Screen:** On supported mobile browsers, you'll see an "Add to Home Screen" prompt, turning your web app into a native-like experience.
